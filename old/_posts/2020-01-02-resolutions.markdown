This worked pretty well last year, so let's go. 

1. No Sugar. And I'm saying it from the cool, relaxing distance of January, but I'm counting Christmas this time. Read these words back to me as I board a plane for Dublin in December. As a side note, I'm going to rule out crisps while I'm here, it was very easy for me to be all letter-of-the-law while absorbing 200g of Pringles at my desk. Be healthy, you goon.
2. _Less_ alcohol. Not a big drinker in general, but I always regret it a little bit. So I'm only going to have drinks 26 times this year, so on average once a fortnight. I've stuck up 26 Post-Its in my kitchen to reserve days or chalk them off as they happen.
3. I'm not making any running resolutions this year because my hip is still fucked. It's been fucked since early November, and I've taken two months off. I ran for 19 minutes on new year's day, and it's still fucked. Fuck. Ah hell let's still say <40 min 10k. Maybe I'll be fixed by the Vitality 10k in May.
4. So I'm going to do a biking one. I'm commiting to bike >50% of my commutes this year, my back-of-the-envelope calculations make that 110 days. In doing that I should rack up about 2500km* and save about Â£900**. 
    - *I basically made up that number as 2019 total + a bit. 
    - **Same
5. Chinese. I'm going to put down HSK3 as a goal, and it will be tough, but the real thing is a larger, non-measurable "get better at Chinese". Speak more. Also keep up the Duolingo thing, since I've paid for it. 
6. Secret goal, talk later.
7. Less tech. Don't use my phone browser. Don't bring my phone to the loo. Basically, don't use my phone. Become bored again while waiting for things. Look out the window. Don't read the comments. Don't read the news, in fact. I mean, stay informed, but stop checking it _constantly_ just to point my eyes at something. Also not super measurable, maybe the number of books I read can be the barometer.
