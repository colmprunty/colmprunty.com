Yeah, it's wet. I've managed to bike to work and back every time I've been in the office this year, but to be fair, it's still January. I bought mudguards though, so at least when I get home I don't have a vertical splatter of London's roads up my back, bag and backside. Happily, I'm counterbalancing all this exercise by eating significant amount of bread and chips. 

Jones has yet to fully recover from his dental surgery. I feel like I have a standing appointment with the vet that takes up every Saturday mid-morning. And yet, he seems totally fine. A good cat.
