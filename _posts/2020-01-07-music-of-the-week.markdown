I've thought a lot about [this article](https://www.talkhouse.com/will-sheff-okkervil-river-talks-about-the-disciplined-listening-system-that-restored-his-love-of-music/) by Will Sheff. The benefits of limitations, artificial or otherwise, appear to crop up in various places. So following that, I'm going to try to listen to two albums a week; one classic that I've never gotten around to, and one new thing. I'll try my best to give each at least 8-10 listens, maybe even one where I'm not doing something else at the same time. Remember being a teenager when you'd just listen to music? Back when you had time to do things like that?

Anyway, here's what I've got for the upcoming week:

Classic - [Transformer by Lou Reed](https://open.spotify.com/album/5SqbMEyAt8332ISGiLX0St)
New - [MAGDALENE by FKA Twigs](https://open.spotify.com/album/2w8Wshbp9RCPJdPU1iOpaY)
