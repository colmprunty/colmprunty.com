Classic: [Supertramp - Crime of the Century](https://open.spotify.com/album/649U8ZM3frAE5Hq90KRhy6)

For this week, I reached out to my buddy [Andrew](http://andrewscottsolo.ca/) who apparently hasn't updated his website in five years and still has the Wordpress favicon, but he came back immediately with an unexpected recommendation.

New: [Billie Eilish - WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?](https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0KGZnfBGSIssfF54WSJh)

Absolutely no idea what to expect here, this is just a name I've seen popping up in various places and I have a vague desire to stay relevant. That album cover is fucking terrifying.
