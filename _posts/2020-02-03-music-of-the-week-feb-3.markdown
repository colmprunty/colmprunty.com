Classic: [Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YabPKtZAjxwyWbuO9p4ZD)

This one is my Dad's suggestion, probably because I already know all the Led Zeppelin and Neil Young albums. 

New: [TOOL - Fear Inoculum](https://open.spotify.com/album/7acEciVtnuTzmwKptkjth5)

TOOL, like King Crimson last week, have resisted Spotify for a very long time, but then last year put everything (including this new album) on there.
