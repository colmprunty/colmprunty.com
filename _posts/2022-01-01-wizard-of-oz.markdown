The 4 year old got a book of various bedtime stories for Christmas, and one of them is the Wizard of Oz. They're all truncated and simplified, but in this edition of Oz, Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion make it to the Wizard and he's just... legitimate. He gives them brains, heart and courage and sends them on their way. (He also sends Dorothy to assassinate another Wicked Witch).

This is a pretty fundamental change in the messageo of the story, there's no "man behind the curtain", you should trust authority, your abilities are not innate and will be given to you by your betters if you ask nicely.
