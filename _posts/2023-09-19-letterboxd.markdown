I'm going to try and double post movie content, like the thing I posted a few minutes ago, here (where I own it) and on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/colmprunty/) (where I don't). If you are reading this (and nobody is reading this), follow me there for identical content to here, but with the option to comment (nobody is commenting). 

I signed up for Letterboxd in 2017, what feels like minutes before First Child was born, and I, in all my wisdom, signed up for a Cineworld unlimited pass. I did not quite anticipate how much time a newborn would take. The first thing I saw and reviewed was pretty standard horror garbage [Life](https://letterboxd.com/colmprunty/film/life-2017/). I've logged all (and reviewed most) of the movies I've seen in the subsequent six years.

In the last year, I have embarked on a project of logging every single movie I can remember having ever seen. At the time of writing, that stands at 1,440. If I say I started watching movies at 13 (obviously it was younger than that, but I didn't really have any autonomy in the matter), that's roughly two a week for 26 years. Some periods (unemployment) have obviously been busier than others (children).

Lastly, while I'm on the subject, nothing annoys me more about Letterboxd than the one-line engagement farming "reviews", I can't even make a joke example of it. Five stars. Shut up.

If you ever read this, internet person, talk to me about movies.
