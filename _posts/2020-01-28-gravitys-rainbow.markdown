`Gravity's Rainbow` is, I'm sure, a towering work of challenging fiction. But it is not one to be dipped into in ten to fifteen minute increments on the bus while someone watches the news out loud, or in bed minutes before the Two-Year-Old wakes up howling because it's too hot and too cold simultaneously, and she wants a small white towel and some water. So I'm canning it for the time being, sorry Tom.
