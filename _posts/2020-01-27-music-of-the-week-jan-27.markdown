Classic: [King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King](https://open.spotify.com/album/5wec5BciMpDMzlEFpYeHse)

There's only some kind of expanded and enhanced version on Spotify, so I'll probably skip the live tracks at the end. Let's prog.

New: [Alexandra Savior - The Archer](https://open.spotify.com/album/6LbyR5pthd2ao8QwxzLtV8?si=9LnW3dR0TG2QlnV9t7g5hA)

No expectations here either, just reached out for something recent. Happy enough that all my new albums have been female solo artists so far.
