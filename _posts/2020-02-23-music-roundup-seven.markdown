## A Night at the Opera

I hadn't really listened to Queen much before this, my abiding impression was of a band with incredibly talented individual members, who for some reason came together to write bullshit novelty songs. There is some of that, mainly `Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon` and `Seaside Rendezvous`, but it's a lot more palatable when there's actually other stuff around. 

As a side note, before I get anywhere, `Bohemian Rhapsody` is on this album. Everyone knows it, it's incredible. It almost feels like cheating this project to listen to it a half dozen times.

And back. Didn't foresee a wee little acoustic sci-fi story by noted [PhD astrophysicist Brian May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May#Scientific_career). I don't know where to categorise `I'm in Love with my Car`, a fairly straightforward tune, but about really liking a car, complete with engine noise at the end.  I read a little about the backstory of the (very good) `Death on Two Legs`, about Freddie Mercury writing a fuck off note to the band's former manager. 

Also in there, I didn't even realise it was Queen, but I must have heard `You're my Best Friend` in about two hundred romcom trailers. 

## The Slow Rush

Yeah, sorry Tame Impala, but I didn't really make much headway with this. Was pleasant to listen to, but nothing really stuck. Except, for some reason, `Posthumous Forgiveness`, which was completely awesome.
