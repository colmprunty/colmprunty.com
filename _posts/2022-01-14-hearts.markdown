What's going on with everyone's hearts? I'm mostly seeing this in the context of football, but is that just the most high profile?

Four Premier League games have been suspended for a period in the last three months because a fan collapsed in the stands. I don't remember this ever happening before now. One in [October](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58947417), two on the same day in [December](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59499149) and one a [couple of days ago](https://www.goal.com/en-tza/news/spurs-clash-with-chelsea-halted-due-to-medical-emergency-in/blt303c7fa84e7fa0e1). I don't necessarily know that these are all heart-related I suppose.

Player-wise the most obvious is [Christian Eriksen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/jun/20/the-day-denmark-stood-still-christian-eriksens-collapse-and-the-heroes-who-saved-him), but Sergio Aguero retired for a [heart problem](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-59593667), and I didn't even realise that a Mali player had a heart attack on the pitch [last week](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ousmane-coulibaly-heart-attack-qatar-25895566), or that John Fleck at Sheffield Utd collapsed on the pitch [in November](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59395982) and then just today Aubameyang is out of an Afcon game for [heart lesions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60003289), whatever those are.

Weird.
